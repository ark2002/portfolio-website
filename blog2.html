    <p><b>The answer to the question is the complexity.</b> 
    With the increased development of the programs there was increased complexities in these programs which were getting too out of hand for the programmers to cope up with C language. Thus this made the need for the ways for managing these complexities.
    <b> C++ was the answer for these needs.</b></p>
    <p>With the creation of C++ a new way of programming came up. <i>The object - oriented way ie. The object oriented programming way.</i>This oop concept helped the programmers to reduce the complexity of a program by using various features of oop like <i>encapsulation , inheritance and polymorphism.</i></p>
  <p>C++ was basically made on the fundamentals of C .<i> You can say that C is the old age cell phones and C++ is the new age smartphones</i> . With smartphones we didn’t completely changed the fundamentals of the cell phones we kept these fundamentals and added new updates and features to it. So the reason behind the immense success of C++ is that it wasn’t an attempt to disregard C and develop a completely new language it was just u can say a system update to c . U can guess that from the original name of C++ which was <i><q>C with classes</q></i> although it got changed to C++.</p>
