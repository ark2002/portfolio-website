    Java is like a paternal step cousin of C++ who is a direct descendent of C . Java derives its syntax from C while gets its object - oriented concept(OOP) from C++. As all the programming languages are created java was also created to solve problems which weren’t feasible or able to solve on the predecessor languages.</p>
<p>When C language was created it shook the computing world . It was the first creation towards use of high level languages in computing and programming .</p>
<p>When ever a new language is created certain tradeoffs are done for the specific purpose for which the language was created . In the case of C the tradeoffs were the to get ease , efficiency and rigidity .</p>
<p>C was a true defination of the programmers language prior to C++ . The languages were generally created for and by the beaurcatic committees . But with C it was created by the programmers for the programmers . The creation of C was like a creation of wheel for the early men , like before wheel early men were still doing and moving stuff but with the creation of wheel men got the freedom and easily could take stuff around forwarding to the evolution . Just like the wheel the programmers were still doing various programmes before the creation of C with the help of Fortran , pascal etc. But with the creation of C the programmers got thier creative freedom , ease of doing stuff without the bounded constrains of the languages prior.</p>
